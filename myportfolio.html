		  <h2>Deisgning a network project</h2>
           <p>	Network Video System Project


            Setting up a network video system for a NBA Basketball game.
            
           <p>1. Camera Network: A camera network would consist of multiple HD cameras strategically placed around the arena. These cameras would record the action from various angles.</p> 
            
            
            <p>2. PoE Switches & Core Switch: PoE (Power over Ethernet) switches would be used at each camera site to provide power to the cameras and process the video data. The PoE switches would then be connected to a core switch which would act as the hub for data consolidation and distribution.</p>
            
            
           <p> 3. IP Addressing: Each camera and switch in the arena receives an assigned IP address within a specific subnet, allowing for efficient communication and management.</p>
            
            
            <p>4.Network Management: A professional team monitors the network to ensure smooth operation, monitor camera status, manage video streams, and address any  issues that may occur during the game.</p>
            
            
            <p>5. Security Measures: Strong security measures are taken to protect the network, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure the integrity of the video stream.</p>
            
            
            <p>6.Broadcasting and streaming: Captured video feeds are managed through a sophisticated video management software (VMS) system. The system employs live broadcasts, instant replays, and various camera angle changes for viewers.</p>
            
            
            <p>7. Documentation: Detailed documentation on network layout, IP addresses, and configuration is maintained for reference and troubleshooting purposes.
                <P>The size and technical requirements of an NBA game's video network include high capabilities, and reliability measures to ensure uninterrupted transmission to millions of viewers around the world. </P>

		  <h2>Networking Paper</h2>
          <div>
            <p>  I wanted to choose the broadway performance Aladdin currently playing in New York City. I have not yet gotten the chance to watch the actual performance in person, but I have watched snippets of the show online and read articles regarding the production. The main departments I think that require networking the most during this production were the lighting and sound systems. 
              I believe the lighting department would have used networking by mostly using a system wirelessly that connects components as told by the show’s production manager Jimmie Lee Smith. As told in the article The hidden tech behind Broadway's Aladdin, the production manager says “The technology on the show is quite extensive," Smith said. "There are a few things operated from a wireless standpoint, there are lots of moving pieces both in the air, on the stage and from beneath the stage." As for the other components Smith describes the required quick life as the designed piece of machinery that ensures the functionality of a genie appearing out of the ground as if it’s magic. He then goes into detail about the clear plexiglass belt-driven lifts used to push some of the performers on stage at the fast date of 12 feet per second. 
              Steve Stackle, a deck automation operator describes the networking involved in the construction of the performance. With a set of 45 machines and about 30 connected by wires and 15 running on a wireless network, “The machines are connected to motor drives which communicate with a main computer that coordinates where the pieces are to be placed on stage.” As for the networking in the sound department, with a list of 20 memorable melodic songs, cast members must wear a tracker that emits a pulse. Ken Travis then described how “The stage is divided into 14 zones, with seven radars across the auditorium listening for the various chirps. Once received, a computer processes the information before sending the sound from the actors' microphones to one of 200 speakers.” The overall networking of the production is a long process but pays off immensely through the reactions of the audience.

    <h2>Reasearch Paper</h2>
      <div>

The garment I chose is the Evening midnight suit made by Prince of Wales During the early 1920’s also known as the Duke of Windsor, He played a very prominent role in the fashion industry. The suit is pigmented from head to toe in a deep navy blue color with white details and accents draped around the collars, arm cuffs, and pockets. A matching white bow tie, white handkerchief, and white gloves are also part of the elegant ensemble. Specifically one of the most prized possessions of the Duke’s wardrobe that had been preserved even after his death would be the midnight blue evening suit. Initially intended to be introduced as an alternative to the “basic” standard  black evening suit. Aside from being a prince he was a well known public figure with a passion for an expensive and unique wardrobe. Interestingly enough the preference for the rich navy color over black came from the attention to detail that would be more visible in strobe light photographs taken during his time period. From this detail alone we can infer to the extent of just how deep the Duke of Windsor’s love for fashion ran. The conventional black men’s suit was the most commonly worn garment for formal events in the early 1900’s.  The Duke of Windsor was certainly one to break and inspire new fashion trends, and that’s one of the reasons the midnight evening suit was born.  At the time, photographs were the only form of a permanent memory holder and the Duke of Windsor knew the importance one photo can hold. That would be just another reason as to why the Duke held a specific preference for the midnight blue color of the evening suit, its dark blue hue revealed more detail against a black and white photo which had been the only result of photography in his lifetime. As opposed to a dark black the navy color registered a lot more in strobe light photographs.
