		</div>
        Hello! I'm Adham Khalil, a passionate traveler and a Senior at New York College of Technology. I'm pursuing a degree in Entertainment Technology, focusing on audio and video.

        My journey in entertainment technology is fueled by my love for exploring new things, both in the world and in technology and creativity. There's something magical about mixing sound and video to create visual experiences, and I'm devoted to mastering this craft.
        
        When I'm not doing coursework, you'll often find me mapping new destinations or capturing moments through the lens of my camera. Traveling isn't just a hobby; it's an avenue for inspiration, a source of new perspectives that elivate my understanding of audiovisual storytelling.
        
        At the heart of my academic pursuits lies a deep fascination with audio and video technology. From understanding sound design to visual storytelling, I thrive on these elements. Through my studies and experiences, I aim to carve a path where technology meets creativity, where every project I undertake has dedication to capture audiences through the power of audio and video.
        
        Join me on this exhilarating journey as I explore, create, and travel through the world of entertainment technology.
